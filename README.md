# Java2PlayerChessGame-GUI
2 player chess game GUI created for my CSE 220 Honors Project. Requires the GUI component to be launched from a CLI.

# Getting Started:
In order to start the actual GUI, it will need to be launched from a CLI or a Java IDE. Launch the MainClass.java through a CLI 
or IDE and follow the prompts using the GUI.

# How to Play:
The actual tiles on the Chess Board are buttons that can be clicked on. Simply click on your peace., and the desired destination
and if the move is valid the piece will move to that position. Game ends when the enemy king is killed. This game is designed to
be played by two people on the same computer. A prompt at the bottom of the window will indicate which players turn it is.
